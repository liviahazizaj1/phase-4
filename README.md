# Question 1
# Introduction to Testing
Software testing is defined as the process of evaluating software to identify defects or bugs. It involves the execution of software/system components using manual or automated tools to evaluate
one or more properties of interest. 


The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements. This process not only assesses the software's functionality but also its security, performance, and compliance with the specified requirements.


Importance of Testing in Software
Development
Testing is critical in software
development due to its impact on the final product's reliability and correctness.
Here are some of the reasons why testing is indispensable:

• Reliability: Testing ensures that the software can perform its tasks under any conditions consistently. It checks the durability of the software under stressful conditions and measures how it handles large amounts of data or sudden spikes in user traffic.

• Correctness: By identifying discrepancies between the software's actual behavior and the expected behavior, testing ensures that the product behaves as intended, which is crucial for user satisfaction and software usability.

• Preventive Measure: Regular and thorough testing helps in detecting defects early, which can prevent costly fixes later in the development cycle.
Early bug detection helps in maintaining the overall project timeline and budget.

• User Trust and Satisfaction: A well-tested software demonstrates reliability and performance, which in turn builds user trust and satisfaction. It ensures that the software is ready for production and can meet the user's needs without frequent crashes or downtime.

# Question 2
# Purpose of Testing
•Early Defect Identification

Testing helps find problems early in the making of the software, just like finding mistakes early when writing an essay is easier than fixing them all at the end.
Catching these bugs early can save a lot of time and money, and makes the final software much better.

•Verification of Software Component
Performance

It's also about making sure each part of the software does its job right. When testing, we check each piece individually (like checking the grammar, spelling, and punctuation in an essay) and then see if all parts work well together (like making sure all paragraphs support the thesis).
